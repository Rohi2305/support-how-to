3.	Enter a tenant name using only letters and numbers.
A tenant is a unique name for your organization within the Office 365 portal. Your tenant name is your **account ID** on Microsoft’s systems.
If the tenant ID that you enter is valid and available, a green check box appears next to the name.
 
4.	Fill in the requested information. All fields are required.

### FAQ

#### Does Rackspace update the customer’s DNS records?
No. Admins are responsible for updating their domain’s DNS records. Rackspace does not have access to your externally hosted DNS and cannot accept access to external DNS hosting accounts.

### Appendix                                                                             
                                                                            
                                                                     
#### Add a domain in Office 365
The default domain in Office 365® is **{tenantName}.onmicrosoft.com**. Until you add your own domain to Office 365, any new users that you create contain the default domain name.  To add a domain follow the steps below.

1.	Log in to your [Office 365 Control Panel](https://manage365.rackspace.com/).
2.	From the left menu, select a drop-down menu labeled “More”. 
3.	Select **Manage In Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.
4.	From the left menu, select **Show All** -> **Settings**, and then select **Domains**.
5.	In the Domains section, click **Add Domain**.
6.	Enter the domain name when prompted, and then click **Use this domain**.
7.	You will be taken to a page titled “Verify that you own the domain.”


#### Verify that you own the domain
This step requires you to log in to your domain’s DNS host portal. If you do not know what your DNS host is, see [Find your DNS host](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/find-dns-host/).

1.	Select the **Add a TXT record to the domains DNS record** option, and then select **Continue**.
2.	Copy the TXT record information provided on the **Verify domain** page.
3.	Log in to your domain’s DNS host portal.
4.	Add the TXT record by using the information provided on the **Verify domain** page.
5.	Save this change at your DNS host & allow 15-30 mins for your record to propagate.
6.	After the TXT record fully propagates, select **Verify in the Microsoft Admin Center**.

After Office 365 verifies your domain and you are ready to use your services, you need to finalize your setup by configuring the remaining DNS entries for your Office 365 services.


#### Configuring DNS records for your Office 365 services
Use the following steps to configure the DNS records for your Office 365 services:
1.	Log in to your [Office 365 Control Panel](https://manage365.rackspace.com/).
2.	From the left menu, select a drop-down menu labeled “More”. 
3.	Select **Manage In Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.
4.	From the left menu, select **Show All** -> **Settings**, and then select **Domains**.
5.	In the Domain section select the Domain you want to configure services for.
6.	From the Domain setup wizard, select **Continue Setup** from the top menu.
7.	On the **Set up your online services** screen, select **I’ll manage my own DNS records** and click **Next**.
8.	When prompted, select the online services you want to configure. The selection is based on the current licenses that are assigned to your users.
9.	After selecting your online services, click **Next**.
This step requires you to log in to your domain’s DNS host portal.
10.	Log in to your DNS host and copy the records from the table provided into your DNS host. Save this change at your DNS host & allow 15-30 mins for your record to propagate.
11.	Once your new DNS records have propagated, go back to your Microsoft Admin Center & select **Verify**.

**Note:** In rare cases it can take up to 24-48 hours for the DNS records to fully propagate from your DNS host and for Office 365 to verify them.
